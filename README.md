# Trust Integrity Index (TII)

## Multi-Axis Political Evaluation Framework

A structured framework to evaluate politicians based on trustworthiness, policy execution, and ethical integrity. This repository is part of the broader POS-supported evaluation ecosystem.

## 🔍 What is POS?

**POS (Political Observation System)** is an advanced AI-guided logic engine that scores political behavior based on factual alignment, behavioral consistency, and impact-based metrics. This system does not rely on biased media narratives and instead tracks real-time actions and long-term trustworthiness trends.
