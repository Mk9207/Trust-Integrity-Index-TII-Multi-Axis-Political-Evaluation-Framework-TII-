# Trust Integrity Index (TII)
A hybrid scoring system for evaluating the integrity and consistency of political figures.

## Overview
This model evaluates public figures using three transparent metrics:
- CI: Consistency Index (alignment between words and actions)
- SC: Speech Composition (logic and structure)
- TB: Tangible Benefit (actual outcome of policies)

The system is designed to be POS-compatible, allowing scalable, trusted evaluation.
